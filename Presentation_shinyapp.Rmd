## App idea - name generator
This app will combine parts of names to generate a new name. 
For example -- the first part of Olivia and last part of Jessica can form the new names Olica and Jessia. 

## Data origin
Wikipedia has a list of the most common names per country/region. From these I took around 10 common prefixes and suffixes. I also took names from my own family (Plomp-Winkler), and added prefixes and suffixes from those. 

The user can choose which type(s) of name parts to add by checking the appropriate boxes.
